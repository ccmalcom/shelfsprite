/**
 * Gates the library-consuming routes behind having a library. On a gated route, if the user's
 * stats show zero books, it renders <SetupWizard> in place (within the main shell — navbar
 * stays) rather than the page. Otherwise it renders the page.
 *
 * The decision is LATCHED: we pick "setup" vs "ready" once, the first time stats are known,
 * and don't flip afterward. That matters because the wizard ingests books mid-flow (total goes
 * 0 → N after the upload step); without latching, the gate would see total > 0 and swap the
 * wizard out before the user reached enrich/profile. The wizard calls `onComplete` at its final
 * step to move us to "ready" deliberately.
