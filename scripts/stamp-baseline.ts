/**
 * One-shot: record the BASELINE migration in drizzle's ledger WITHOUT
 * executing its SQL. Used once, to adopt drizzle-kit on a database that
 * Alembic built (production is at alembic head 0019_add_enrich_job_leases).
 * Everything after 0000 is a real migration and belongs to `db:migrate`.
 *
 * Running this against a database that does NOT already have the schema
 * leaves you with an empty DB that drizzle believes is fully migrated.
 * Guard: it refuses to stamp unless `books` already exists.
