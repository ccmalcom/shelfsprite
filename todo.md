# TODO

## BUGS

- **Enrichment continuation: FIXED and verified in production 2026-08-13.** One item still open —
  see "remaining" below.
  **Root cause, and it was never `CRON_SECRET`.** `proxy.ts`'s matcher covered `/api/*`, so
  `updateSession` 307-redirected the cookieless internal `/api/enrich/tick` fetch to `/login`
  before the handler ran — and did the same to the cron-invoked `/api/enrich/janitor`, so the
  janitor had never run either. Fixed by adding `api` to the matcher's negative lookahead, plus a
  `response.ok` check in `rearmAfterResponse` so a non-2xx tick is logged instead of silently
  counted as success. Both mutation-tested. Merged as `e2c373e` (PR #43).
  The un-guarded dispatch that made this dangerous was fixed separately in `ef28810`: both call
  sites now catch, `runClaimedChunk` returns `rearmed: false` instead of throwing,
  `repairActiveJobs` survives a mid-sweep failure and counts it in `dispatchFailed`. Both guards
  are mutation-tested. See `docs/hosting.md`.
  **Verified on `shelfsprite.app`** under a temporary 100s budget: a forced 159-book run spanned
  two chunks and reached `done` at 159/159. `CHUNK_BUDGET_MS` reverted to `240_000` in `2b4686c`.
  **Remaining: confirm the janitor fires at `17 3 * * *` UTC — it never has.** First real
  opportunity is the night of 2026-08-13, now that the matcher fix is deployed.
  Two criteria corrections worth keeping:
  - **"≥ 2 ticks, never `done`" was the wrong bar** — it was extrapolated from a 221s run, and the
    149s verification run legitimately produced exactly 1 tick. The real bar is a tick invocation
    **and** progress advancing across the chunk boundary.
  - **Tick count alone is never evidence** — 21 ticks once coexisted with progress frozen at
    65/159, every one a 307 triggered by a status poll's poll-repair redispatch.
    **`tick→tick` chaining is still unproven**: the verification job finished inside its first tick,
    so no tick ever had to re-arm another. At `240_000` this library completes in one chunk and
    cannot test it — needs a ~`40_000` budget or a much larger library.
    Do NOT test any of this on a preview deployment: Vercel SSO is enabled
    (`all_except_custom_domains`), so a preview tick is intercepted by the protection layer too — a
    second, independent cause with the same symptom.
    Residual: the only automatic recovery is `failIfStale`, which fires on a _user-initiated status
    poll_, not a timer. Verified live 2026-08-13 — a job abandoned at 15:29:06 was marked `error`
    with `Enrichment was interrupted, please retry.` at 16:00:12 (1866s, past the strict 1800s
    threshold), preserving `progress` at 65/159.

- ~~**Add-book search ranking scores correct matches 0.**~~ **FIXED 2026-08-13, Node only.**
  Root cause was `matchScore` (`lib/server/catalog.ts`, mirror of `_match_score`,
  `mylibrary/catalog.py:449`) — NOT retrieval. Both defects are fixed:
  1. `normFull` mapped non-alphanumerics to a _space_, so `"The Android's Dream"` became
     `the android s dream` with a stray `s` token and the query `the androids dream` failed all
     five bands → score 0. Apostrophes (`['’ʼ‘]`) now elide to empty _before_ the
     `[^a-z0-9 ]`→space pass.
  2. Query tokens could never span title AND author. `matchScore` now peels author-matching
     tokens off the query and scores the remainder against the title, in bands above the
     title-only ones. **Graded 95 (remainder == title) / 92 (title starts with remainder) / 90
     (remainder ⊆ title tokens)** — this grading was NOT in the original write-up and is
     load-bearing: a single flat band leaves _The Lock In Series_ tied with _Lock In_, which
     then wins on the year tiebreaker.
     **Python's `_match_score` was deliberately NOT fixed** (Chase's call 2026-08-13) — it serves
     zero traffic and is deleted with the rest of `mylibrary/`. Parity survived anyway:
     `catalog-search.test.ts` still passes untouched, because neither fix moves `dune`,
     `ancillary justice`, or the ISBN query, so `expected.json` needed no regeneration.
     Covered by `catalog-ranking.test.ts` — behavioral, not parity, tests against real pools
     recorded by `scripts/gen_search_ranking_fixtures.py`. That recorder **merges into
     `http.json` additively on purpose**: a full `gen_catalog_fixtures.py` re-record also
     regenerates `enrichment-expected.json`, whose seven seeds were hand-picked by probing live
     catalogs to hit five specific match branches, and can flip one for reasons unrelated to search.
     Live-verified against real catalogs on an isolated Postgres: `the androids dream`,
     `lock in scalzi` and `scalzi lock in` all went from absent-in-top-8 to #1; `lock in`,
     `the fault in our stars` and `ancillary justice` unaffected.
- **Search tiebreakers favor recency over canonicity** (separate, pre-existing, lower priority).
  The year-DESC tiebreaker in `searchBooks`' sort comparator floats reissues and study guides
  above canonical works — plain `dune` returns Kevin J. Anderson's above Frank Herbert's.
  **Confirmed still live 2026-08-13** after the ranking fix above, which does not address it.
  Note the committed `dune` fixture pool happens to order Herbert first, so no fixture-driven
  test can currently reproduce this — a fresh recording is needed, in its OWN fixture file, so
  it does not overwrite the pool `catalog-search.test.ts`'s parity assertions depend on.
  Two candidate signals, neither free:
  - `edition_count` from Open Library is the right signal but is **not** in the `fields` param
    we request; adding it changes the request URL, and the parity test replays recorded URLs
    asserting Node issued the same requests as the retired implementation. That blocker is now
    gone because the old implementation and parity harness were deleted; the tiebreaker itself is
    still open.
  - Counting dedup sightings (`mergeInto` already collapses duplicate editions across all four
    fetches; a canonical work has far more) needs no URL change and is source-neutral —
    viable now. Untried.
    Google's `ratingsCount` was evaluated and rejected: sparse and tiny (25, 5, 3, mostly absent),
    and absent entirely from Open Library, so it acts as a source preference rather than a
    tiebreaker.

## Python retirement — repository cleanup complete

Production has served the Next.js route handlers exclusively since `fdc5c84`; the full smoke
(sign-in, library, profile, `POST /recommend`, multi-chunk enrichment) passed on
`shelfsprite.app` 2026-08-13 with zero Railway traffic and zero non-200s. The repository-side
retirement is complete. **Railway was PAUSED on 2026-08-13, with deletion deferred until on or
after 2026-08-20** (a paused service costs nothing and can be restored during the safety window).

The following pre-Railway-delete capture list is deliberately retained. The masked
`FEEDBACK_PROMPTS_ENABLED` value and Railway's 7-day traffic log disappear with the service, so
code deletion does not close these evidence tasks:

Before the delete:

- [ ] Confirm the janitor fired (see the enrichment item under BUGS). **Vercel runtime-log
      retention does not reach `03:17 UTC`** — a 24h log query returns nothing for the janitor and
      an explicit 02:00–06:00 UTC window fails with `ExceedsBillingLimitError`, so absence of log
      lines is a false negative, not evidence. The cron IS registered (`vercel crons ls` →
      `/api/enrich/janitor`, `17 3 * * *`). Needs a different evidence source — e.g. have the
      janitor write a durable row, or catch it inside the retention window.
- [x] Record Railway's environment-variable names into the ledger — done 2026-08-14, all eleven in
      `docs/hosting.md` under "Railway's environment, recorded at retirement". Two absences were
      findings in themselves (`REDIS_URL` never set, confirming arq was never the production path;
      no `MYLIBRARY_*` tuning vars, so production ran on code defaults). It also turned up the two
      items below.
- [ ] **Set `FRONTEND_URL=https://shelfsprite.app` on Vercel.** Node's `inviteUser`
      (`supabaseAdmin.ts:123`) reads it to build the invite `redirect_to`; it was set on Railway and
      is absent from Vercel, so since cutover Supabase has been falling back to its dashboard Site
      URL. Invite-only product — this is the only way anyone joins. Needs a redeploy to take effect.
- [ ] **Confirm what `FEEDBACK_PROMPTS_ENABLED` was set to on Railway.** Node defaults it to `true`
      when unset and it is absent from Vercel, so if Railway held `false` the cutover silently
      re-enabled targeted feedback prompts. The value was masked when the names were recorded.
- [ ] Re-confirm zero traffic from Railway's own 7-day request log.

Repository retirement work:

- [x] Drizzle baseline generated from a production `pg_dump`, **never** a fresh `alembic upgrade
head`; `docs/hosting.md` records the two legitimate `enrich_jobs.progress`/`total` shapes.
- [x] Delete `mylibrary/`, `tests/`, `alembic/`, and the fixture recorders.
- [x] Strip `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` and the retired backend switcher; `lib/api.ts` now uses
      the same-origin `/api` base directly.
- [x] Fix add-book search ranking — done early, 2026-08-13, without waiting for the delete. Node
      only; the parity fixture turned out not to be a blocker (see BUGS above).
- [ ] Fix the search canonicity tiebreaker using Open Library `edition_count`. The delete removed
      the request-parity blocker, but no replacement signal has landed. Skip if the
      dedup-sightings alternative (see BUGS) lands first.
- [x] Rewrite `CLAUDE.md` in the present tense with no wave numbering.

## enhancements

- Social — add friends, see each other's activity, etc.
- ui/ux full review
- Invite email setup on external service

## Done

## Wave 1 — Launch blockers - COMPLETE

- Cost guardrails + rate limiting (paired; spend/abuse control under multi-user BYO-key) — **done**
  - Per-user Anthropic spend visibility/limits so big libraries don't cause a surprise bill — **done**: soft-warn spend tracking shipped (`usage_events` table, `/settings` usage panel, `UsageWarningBanner`; never blocks a call)
  - `/catalog/search` per-user rate limiting (hits OL + Google Books live per keystroke) — **already satisfied**, no code change: the existing 30/min per-user SlowAPI limit on `/catalog/search` already covers this

## Wave 2 — Onboarding friction - COMPLETE

- Custom imports — biggest adoption lever (Goodreads is import-once)
  - StoryGraph, Google Play Books, Apple Books, generic CSV / other library managers
  - Manual single-book add is a slog; reduce friction
- Backup / export of in-app ratings & reviews (trust feature, adjacent to import work)

- Cost guardrails + rate limiting — soft-warn per-user spend tracking shipped (`usage_events`, `/settings` usage panel, `UsageWarningBanner`); `/catalog/search` rate limiting was already satisfied by the existing 30/min SlowAPI limit, closed with no code change
- Invite flow / account management — admin console shipped; invite + revoke users + view roster
- BUGS — cleared
- No-Anthropic-key error UX — shows error + prompts for key on profile/recommend
- Onboarding empty state — setup/onboarding wizard shows on home / swipe / my library

## Wave 3 — Recommender depth - COMPLETE

- "More books like this" from a selected library book (smallest, highest-visibility win, specific recommendations based only on selected book)
- NL discovery — natural-language "find me a book like X" search (builds on the above)
- Full feedback / labeling surface — surface LOW-confidence enrichment matches for correction

## Wave 4 — Delight & growth - COMPLETE

- Spotify Wrapped-style profile reveal on onboarding
  - in general, I want to spice up the onboarding flow by immediately surfacing the profile to the user (possibly each trait individually) and the user approving/denying/modifying. Also maybe we should add some more metadata to the profile like favorite genres, authors, types (short story, novella, novel, seires, etc.)
- Admin console — users, token usage, API usage, feedback (overlaps Wave 1 cost visibility)

## Shelves & data model

## openrouter instead of only claude
